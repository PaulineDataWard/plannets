COMMIT BEFORE YOU MERGE
MERGE BEFORE YOU COMMIT
ARGH!

Cannot do a partial commit.

Need to do:

git pull origin master
It finds a conflict. I edit the file to chop out the marked up bits.
git add mars-bars.txt
git commit -a
git push origin master

Hourah!

# Pauline#s starting
Matt Damon rules.
I'm gonna have to science the sh** outta this. Or A Marzzs a day helps you work, rest and play!
import SpaceTravel.pkg

# in between
I changing line 1 and2
just to screw up -

blahblahblah

?!?! - screwing up your line
Take me to your feeder.
# comments are good.

Keeping this: Now I can add my stuff - cyril

# This is Pauline's extra content
When I did sync, having re-named the file, it merged the line Cyril had added into mars.txt to my mars-bars.txt. So I had to actively re-load it into Atom, otherwise I would not have noticed the line that Cyril added.

# Conflicts resolved
let me add another one - with wrong file name


# === Re-added conflict information ====
#Unnecessary!
Now I can add my stuff - cyril
let me add anopter one - with wrong file name
trying again
# delete the bits of markup about conflicts to resolve conflicts.
